    <h3 id="causes2"><br>In adults, lifestyle-related risk factors, such as smoking, being overweight, not getting enough exercise, eating an unhealthy diet etc. play a major role in many types of Cancer. But lifestyle factors usually take many years to cause cancer risk, and they are not known to play much role in childhood cancers.<br><br></h3>
    
    <div id="causes3">
        <br><br><br>
        <li>A few environmental factors, such as the exposure of radiation, has been linked with some types of childhood cancers.</li>
        <li>A research has also suggested that smoking tobacco might increase a child's risk of certain cancers, but more research is needed to explore these possible links.</li>
        <li> Most cancers in children are caused when the alterations in genes is caused it leads to uncontrolled cell growth and eventually cancer.</li>
        <li>Genetic changes that are passed from parents to their children—known as germline variants—can be linked with an increased risk of cancer.</li>
        <li>Genetic changes that lead to the cancer can also occur spontaneously in the cells during development.</li>

    <h3>So far, most childhood cancers have not been shown to have the environmental causes but<br> genetic changes remain a major cause to most common cancers like Leukemia and Brain tumors.</h3>

    <h1 id="prevention1">Prevention</h1>
    <h3 id="prevention2"><br>Children's genes, the DNA that they inherit from their parents, influence their risk of cancer which is not something that can be changed. But lifestyle and environment at a smaller extent but still influence their risk, and there can be an 'Impact'.<br><br></h3>
<div id="prevention3"><br>
    <li>Children should have a healthy diet with lots of fiber, fruits and vegetables. Processed meats and an overabundance of red meat and salt should be avoided.</li>
    <li>Children should be encouraged to do. Exercise stabilizes levels of hormones like estrogen and insulin that have been linked to cancer.</li>
    <li>Fatty tissues produce hormones that influence the way cells grow. Cell overgrowth is at the root of cancers. Hence children should be encouraged to have a healthy body weight.</li>
    <li>Indoor pesticides have recently been found to increase children's risk of Leukemia by 47%.</li>
    <li>Cancer causing chemicals such as arsenic, benzene, and asbestos are still used in textile industry, we should ban using those chemicals and come out with a replacement.</li>
